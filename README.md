This is Bevmaster.
A spec ap for a spec product.

You can create a beverage, by selecting the colors and it will generate a can for that color scheme. 
Future implementations will include images that can be wrapped on the can.

Bevmaster allows one to then vote on said can, and votes will show up next to each can.
The 'master' then rates the can design and gives a verbose statement of whether or not it should succeed.

User profiles show your voting distribution, the amount of beverages you've created, and will eventually include your rank.

This app runs on Rails 4.  PostgreSQL backend.
Snazzy D3 chart Snap.svg javascript libraries.
